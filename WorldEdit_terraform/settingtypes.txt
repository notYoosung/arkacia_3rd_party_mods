worldedit_terraform_radius_limit   (The maximum radius of the terraform command)  int 10
# 20 is default, which ranges the threshold between 0.4 and 0.6 for 0-100 in the command. 0 disables it, 100 ranges it between 0 and 1
worldedit_terraform_threshold_multiplier (Multiplier for the threshold) int 20
# lower makes it more center targeted, high makes it more equally distributed
worldedit_terraform_gauss_sigma (The sigma value for the gaussian kernel) int 4
# Higher values make it more accurate, but the computation time increase cubic along with the terraform radius
worldedit_terraform_guass_radius (The radius for the gaussian kernel) int 2
